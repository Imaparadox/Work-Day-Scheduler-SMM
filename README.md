## Description 
Welcome to the Work-Day-Scheduler! The current date is displayed to assist with creating a schedule for the user. Enter the user events into the time blocks, and click the save button to store the events in the user's inspector local storage. Refreshing the page won't clear the entries in the Application/local storage. The current time will affect each time block's colors, indicating what time slots are available.
